# Environment

After copying `.env.example` you can see the

```shell
APP_SERVER=vps
```

you must change the value same as server do you use, we have two option for that

- vps
- cpanel

:::info

When you use `cpanel`, make sure you have access to creating database, if you does't have access to creating database, the app will throw exception because tenant does't have database to connect
