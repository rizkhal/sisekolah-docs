# Subdomain

Because this application using dynamic subdomain, so you also must have Dynamic [Domain Name System (DNS)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/)

## How to setup dynamic subdomain?

A wildcard DNS record is a record that will match requests for non-existent subdomains. A wildcard DNS record is specified by using a **`*`** as the part of a domain name, e.g. **\*.example.com**

:::info

A wildcard DNS record does not cover a root domain (e.g. yourdomain.tld), thus you will need to create a record for @ host additionally.
Also, if a separate subdomain is created, it has a higher priority than wildcard.

:::

A wildcard record can be set up for the following record types: A, AAAA, ALIAS, CNAME, TXT, URL Redirect, MX.

The sample config is below

| Type     | Host | Value                  |
| -------- | ---- | ----                   |
| A Record | \*   | Your Server IP Address |
