# Provider

## Default Provider

By default Laravel have five providers under the `app/Providers` directory, you can check it by your self if you want to make any change, we just notice to custom provider we created

## Custom Provider

Currently, we only have two custom providers under the `app/Providers` directory

### MacroServiceProvider

In this provider, we creating some `macro` function using **Laravel Macroable** magic function

#### Relations

We have `BelongsToMany` relations macroable to check current `plans` and `coupons` applied to current tenant.
For plans, you can do like below

```php
$currentPlanApplied = tenant()->plans()->current();
```

That will return current `plans` applied or null if current tenant does't have `plans`

For coupons

```php
$currentCouponApplied = tenant()->coupons()->current();
```

That will return current `coupons` applied for current `plans` or null if current tenant does't have `plans` or have `plans` but does't have `coupons`.

The `current` method also accept `callable` parameter if you want to make some conditional

```php
$currentPlanApplied = tenant()->plans()->current(function(Builder $query) {
    return $query->where('column', 'whatever');
});
```

When you pass the argument, the default query is not called because we using `->when()` conditional and only running query from argument, or default query if argument is not passed

#### Request

You can check the incoming request **has tenant** or not using

```php
if ($request->hasTenant()) {
    // has tenant
}
```

Or you can check using spatie build in function

```php
Tenant::checkCurrent();
```

Please refer from spatie multitenancy docs [here](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-multitenancy/v3/basic-usage/working-with-the-current-tenant)

#### RedirectResponse

We have four redirect response `macroable` for append some session to inertia props

- success
- info
- warning
- error

You can use that's like

```php
return back()->success(__('Your success message here'));
```

It will fire vue3 toast to create notification based on what method do you use

We also have `title` created from `Inertia\Response` macroable, thats will append your page title to inertia, you can use like

```php
return inertia('page/to/view')->title(__('Your awesome page title here'));
```

#### Builder

We have `Builder` macroable to `shorthand` search term from database called `whereLike`, you can use that like

```php
Model::query()->when($request->get('query'), function(Builder $query, $searchQuery) {
    return $query->whereLike(['column', 'column.with.relations'], trim($searchQuery));
})->get();
```

### NavigatorServiceProvider

In this provider, we use to create menu for user, we using [this great package](https://github.com/nedwors/navigator) to create our menu navigator

All of the custom provider is registered at `config/app.php`
